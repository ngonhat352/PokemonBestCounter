**Pokemon GO: Best Counters**

Start the program by running the main.py file. 

For input, put in the name of a Pokemon. If it has an Alolan form, put in the name of the Pokemon and 'Alolan' in the parentheses. 
For example, 'Vulpix (Alolan)'. 

Also, if it has many forms, type the name of the Pokemon and then the form in parentheses. 
For example, 'Giratina (Altered)'.

If you don't know anything about Pokemon, we got you! You can try out these inputs: 'Regigigas', 'Darkrai', 'Virizion', 'Moltres', 'Charizard', 
'Raichu (alolan)', 'Giratina (Origin)', 'Roserade', 'Terrakion', etc.
